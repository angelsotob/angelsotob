## About me

I am an engineer with a solid background in embedded systems, electronics and software development. I value honesty, reliability and continuous improvement. I don't pretend to know everything, but I work actively to learn and grow — especially in software engineering.

In recent years, I've focused on making my work more modular, maintainable and scalable, both in professional and personal projects.

## 🚀 What do I do?

At work and on my own, I'm currently designing and implementing embedded solutions that combine:
- FreeRTOS and microcontrollers (ARM, ESP32, PIC)
- Communication protocols: UART, I2C, SPI, CAN
- Test automation and internal tooling with Python
- Digital electronics and PCB design (KiCad / Altium)
- Embedded servers integration (Linux, SCPI, web UI)

I'm also exploring personal projects such as:
- Robotics with omnidirectional wheels
- Integrating classic joysticks into modern systems
- Self-hosted servers and websites on BeagleBone boards
- I also build and test full-stack hardware-software prototypes for robotics, IoT and automation.
